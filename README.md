# Disclaimer: This project is to create a basic POC to get libprotobuf working inside an enclave. It is not scrubbed for vulnerabilities and is not meant to be used in production

# Build and use protobuf with Open Enclave

## Build or install Open Enclave
See [Open Enclave](https://github.com/openenclave/openenclave) repo for instructions.

## Clone the repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/openenclave/openenclave-protobuf --recursive
cd openenclave-protobuf
git submodule init
```
### Apply the patch that enables building libprotobuf_oe_enclave.lib which uses OE headers and compiler flags
```bash
cd protobuf
git am ../0001-Add-ability-to-build-libprotobuf_oe_enclave.patch
```
## Build protobuf including libraries for host and enclave

```bash
mkdir build
cd build
export CXX=/usr/bin/clang++-7
export CC=/usr/bin/clang-7
cmake -Dprotobuf_WITH_ZLIB=OFF -Dprotobuf_BUILD_TESTS=OFF  ../cmake
make
```

## Install protobuf

```bash
cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/opt/protobuf ../cmake
sudo make install
```

## Start using the newly installed protobuf

```bash
export PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/opt/protobuf/lib/pkgconfig:${PKG_CONFIG_PATH}
export PATH=/opt/protobuf/bin:${PATH}
```

## Build the sample
See sample's [README](sample/README.md).
